# Vision

A user-driven recipe collection for cocktails for everyone that likes to make their own more or less fancy
drinks but does not know how to make them. The idea is that every user can create an account where he or she
can add their own drinks, get ideas for new drinks, save recipes to their favorits, rate drinks or just browse
for new ideas.

# Currently implementing
- User can add their own ingridiens to a recipe (Issue [#76](/../../issues/76))
- Search functionality in recipe list (Issue [#8](/../../issues/8))
- View for recommended drinks (Issue [#10](/../../issues/10))

# Already implemented features

- Communication between frontend and backend (Issue [#30](/../../issues/30), [#40](/../../issues/40))
- Russian Laguage support (Issues [#39](/../../issues/39), [#44](/../../issues/44))
- User Log out (Issues [#51](/../../issues/51), [#56](/../../issues/56))
- Feature to delete recipes (Issues [#16](/../../issues/16), [#6](/../../issues/6), [#64](/../../issues/64), [#67](/../../issues/67))
